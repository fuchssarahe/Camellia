  "The flavor and complexity of this tea were truly unique, but I really wish the tea was available loose, rather than exclusively in tea bags.",
  "What a trip down memory lane! My grandfather user to prepare this tea for us very carefully. I can't wait to share the experience with my own grandchildren.",
  "What a disappointment! Gross tea, expensive, and I couldn't buy less than 4 ounces!",
  "While this tea tasted nice, it was too easy to burn for my taste. I doubt I'll be buying the tea again.",
  "I love that this tea comes in both bags and looseleaf, but the quality is clearly very different between the two. Steer clear of the bags.",
  "This tea has such a nice aroma - I can always tell when my partner is making a cup. It's a little dusty, however, so the cup always has some crud in it at the end.",
  "I love this tea! It's perfect for right after dinner. We can get several steeps out of it, so we only need one set of tea leaves for the whole family!",
